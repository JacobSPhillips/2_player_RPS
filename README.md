The program will ask for player 1's choice. Once entered, multiple "no cheating" statements will be printed to prevent peaking at the prior input. Player 2's choice will be input. Both inputs will be changed 
to lower case answers. The program will then check player 1's input for validity. If the input is valid, the program will check for player 2's input validity. I check this way so that I can safely use 
"if player1 == player2" and not worry if the users both input "1" or "x". Once both inputs have been verified, the program will go through every scenario where player 2 wins. If one of the situations is true,
a statement will be printed saying so. Then the program checks if player 1's input is the same as player 2's input. If so, a Tie statement will be printed. Every other scenario has player 1 winning and a statement
saying so will be printed.
